# BankManagementSystem_In_C

The Bank Management System is a console-based application designed to manage customer accounts within a banking system. This project serves as a basic representation of a banking system with functionalities such as creating new accounts, deleting accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, displaying account details, updating account information, and listing all existing accounts.

Key Features:

1. Account Creation: Users can create new bank accounts by providing their personal information, including name, surname, and date of birth. Each account is assigned a unique identification number (ID) and an initial balance of 1000 units.

2. Account Deletion: Users have the ability to delete existing accounts by specifying the account ID. The system then removes the account from the database, updating the account list accordingly.

3. Deposits and Withdrawals: Account holders can deposit funds into their accounts or withdraw funds, subject to the availability of sufficient balance. The system performs validations to ensure the correctness of input and notifies the user of successful transactions.

4. Account Information Display: Users can view a list of all existing accounts, including their names, surnames, account IDs, balances, and date of birth.

5. Account Details: The system allows users to view detailed information about a specific account, either by providing the account ID or the account holder's name.

6. Account Information Update: Users can update their account details, including their name, surname, and date of birth. The system performs validations to ensure the accuracy of the provided information.

7.Random ID Generation: When creating a new account, the system generates a unique identification number (ID) for the account, enhancing security and avoiding conflicts.

User-Friendly Console Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive console interface for users to interact with the banking system.

The project includes error handling mechanisms to ensure the user inputs valid data.
The "izvestaj.txt" file logs important transactions and updates made within the system, providing an audit trail.
